# vgit
vgit is a clean and simple developer CLI tool for committing or pushing code to git easily with one simple command.

## Installing
To install this tool, all you do is:
- grab the vgit file in this repository and place it in a $PATH folder (recommended for mac: `/usr/local/bin`).
- run `chmod u+x vgit` in the folder with the script
- it can now be accessed globally as a CLI

## Using the CLI
### Committing
Committing is immensely simple. The syntax is: `vgit "COMMIT TEXT HERE"`

### Pushing
To push the commits you have made, execute `vgit -p`.
